    Inside project folder, you will see these folder:

        1. api                  : contains all APIs
        2. common               : contains COMMON module, each service needs to import this
        3. dev                  : contains all setup for dev environment
        4. discovery            : contains DISCOVERY module

Step 10: Run docker-compose --> for all, who just want to run project without any code modifying, or setting up environment

    1. Move into dev folder
    2. Prepare database by backup from previous version (all .bak files are stored inside database/backup folder) or run scripts inside database/script folder
        2.1. Backup USER database (user.bak) or (user_schema.sql + user_data.sql)
        2.2. Backup AUTH database (auth.bak) or (auth_schema.sql + auth_data.sql)

        2.4. Backup BOOKING database (booking.bak) or (booking_schema.sql + booking_data.sql)
    3. Edit .env file to best suit your case (database host + database port + database username + database password + timezone)
    4. Open terminal and run $ docker-compose up to start Saigon Parking project (run inside dev folder)
    5. Check all services health by running $ docker-compose ps (run inside dev folder, open new terminal tab. If all is "UP" that means healthy/ run successfully)
