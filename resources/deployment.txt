========================================================================================================================

We will simply deploy our system in 2 VM instances in GCP: Gateway & Service
Each VM instance needs to be installed & run docker on it. (Docker host)
Because we will deploy multiple apps as multiple docker containers in host (VM instance)
Client request/response flow when calling an API: (there are 2 available protocols: HTTP & GRPC)

                            (Docker Host)               (Docker Host)

About these VM instances:

Gateway is the 1st vm instance in GCP (A)
Gateway prerequisites: Ubuntu 18.04, 8GB RAM, 20GB SSD, Teamviewer for Remote Control
Gateway is config with static EXTERNAL IP address: referenced by www.saigonparking.wtf
Gateway will be reached by Client via SSL encrypted communication(s).

Gateway public ports:
    + 80:   WEB
    + 443:  WEB SSL
    + 8000: API HTTP
    + 8443: API HTTP SSL
    + 9080: API GRPC/HTTP2
    + 9081: API GRPC/HTTP2 SSL
    + 8432: GATEWAY POSTGRES DB

    + 8444: KONG ADMIN HTTP SSL

Service is another vm instance in GCP (B)
Service prerequisites: Ubuntu 18.04, 8GB RAM, 20GB SSD, Teamviewer for Remote Control
Service is config with static INTERNAL IP address: referenced by saigonparkingservice
Service will be reached by Gateway via non-SSL plain-text communication(s).
