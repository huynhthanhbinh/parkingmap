All necessary setup files are provided in Parking Map Project's private Google Drive. Please do NOT share anything outside

Step 00: Download all necessary things: ( dependencies / libraries / tools / plugins / project )

    1. Download all tools + setup + settings from Google Drive.

    2. Clone Parking Map project from private repository:

                            https://github.com/huynhthanhbinh/parkingmap

Step 01: Setup JAVA

    1. Install Java 8 included JDK 1.8 + JRE 1.8 (using jdk-8u241-windows-x64.exe)
    2. Add JAVA_HOME variable (path to JDK folder) to environment variables
    3. Add %JAVA_HOME%\bin (path to JDK bin folder) to PATH in environment variables

Step 02: Setup MAVEN

    1. Unzip Maven setup file into Program File folder (using apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip)
    2. Add M2_HOME variable (path to recent unzipped folder) to environment variables
    3. Add %M2_HOME%\bin (path to MVN bin folder) to PATH in environment variables

Step 03: Setup PARKING-MAP environment variables

    1. Add PARKINGMAP_RESOURCES_DIR (path to RESOURCES folder) to SYSTEM Variables in Environment Variables
    2. Restart your PC for system to apply new environment variables !!! (Must do before move to next step!)

Step 04: Check if set up environment variables is success or not

    1. Open terminal/command line
    2. Tap java -version (if the command line show java's version -> setup java is success !)
    3. Tap  mvn -version (if the command line show maven's version -> setup maven is success !)

Step 05: Install IDE:

    1. Install IntelliJ IDEA IDE (Ultimate version is recommended, using student's email to register)
    2. Remove previous project setting (if exists)
    2. Import current project setting into IntelliJ IDE (please using IntelliJ_Settings.jar provided)
    3. Start IntelliJ IDEA IDE and start to install plugins as the following step

Step 06: Install IDE must-have plugins: (please install all of these following plugins)

    1. SonarLint
    2. Grep Console
    3. Save Actions
    4. Spring Assistant
    5. Jpa Support
    6. Protobuf Support
    7. MapStruct Support
    8. Lombok

Step 07: Setup Save Actions plugin:

    1. Open File -> Settings -> Other Settings -> Save Actions
    2. Please select all options as mentioned below
        2.1.  Activate save actions on save
        2.2.  Activate save actions on shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + S): please using this shortcut key on saving code
        2.3.  Optimize imports
        2.4.  Reformat file
        2.5.  Add missing @Override annotations
        2.6.  Add blocks to if/while/for statements
        2.7.  Remove unnecessary this to fields and methods
        2.8.  Remove final from private method
        2.9.  Remove unnecessary final to local variable or parameter
        2.10. Remove explicit generic type for diamond
        2.11. Remove unused suppress warning annotations
        2.12. Remove unnecessary semicolons
    3. Click Apply to save these settings then click OK to close

Step 08: Open project

    1. Right click on parkingmap folder -> Select "Open Folder as IntelliJ IDEA Project"
    2. Project is now open
    3. Wait for IDE to index project, install missing dependencies(libraries)
    4. Select right version of Maven !!! (> 3.5)
        4.1. Open File -> Settings
        4.2. Tap "Maven" -> Maven Settings will be shown on the right side
        4.3. Select Maven Home Directory (for eg. C:/Program Files/Apache/apache-maven-3.6.1)
        4.4. Click Apply to save these settings then click OK to close
    5. Project will be shown as modules (folder icon with small square blue marker)
    6. There are now 3 modules in current project, included 1 parent, 2 children
        6.0. You will see each module will have a unique .pom file (special file of Maven)
        6.1. Parent module: parkingmap  -> we will mention it as parkingmap's pom (or parent pom)
        6.2. Children module:
            6.2.1. SERVER -> we will mention it as SERVER's pom
            6.2.2. API -> we will mention it as API's pom
    7. If modules are not shown in the left panel or any pom has red-underline as errors, please do as followings steps:
        7.1. Open the parent pom (parkingmap's pom) in the IDE
        7.2. As the pom has been shown on the editor, please right-click on the editor
        7.3. Select Maven -> Reimport
        7.4. Modules will be shown and all red-underline in any pom file must be disappeared ! Otherwise, contact me !
    8. PLEASE update password of your SQL server 'sa' account in SERVER/src/main/resources/application.properties
    9. Finish opening project for the 1st time ! Congrats !
    
Step 09: Understand project components / project structure

    Inside project folder, you will see these folder:
        1. API          : contains API module
        2. BUILD        : contains built files: *.jar / *.war
        3. DATABASE     : contains database scripts and diagram
        4. REFERENCES   : contains all references as documents or photos
        5. RESOURCES    : contains all resources of server: images,...
        6. SERVER       : contains SERVER module
        7. SETUP        : contains SETUP files, setup guide (this file)
        8. Another git's file included:
            8.1. .gitattributes : for using LFS (Git Large File Storage)
            8.2. .gitignore     : for ignoring special files or folders
            8.3. LICENSE        : Apache License of this project
            8.4. README.md      : Introduction of this project

Step 10: Try to run server (LOCAL) by package and run executable .jar file (server-parking-map.jar)
        (this step requires Java, Maven, IDE, project already installed and set up, see Step01 -> Step08)

    0. If you did not have the project's database on your computer, please do the following steps: (SETUP DATABASE STEP)
        0.1. Open SSMS (Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio)
        0.2. Create new database, named it 'PARKINGMAP'
        0.3. Open DATABASE folder and execute all .sql files by order
        0.4. 1st, execute 01_db_schema.sql
        0.5. 2nd, execute 02_db_trigger.sql
        0.6. 3rd, execute 03_db_function.sql
        0.7. 4th, execute 04_db_data.sql
        0.8. do NOT need to execute 05_db_query.sql, it just contains some sample written queries
        0.9. all project database has been set up successfully, see 06_db_diagram for more detail about relationships
    1. Register PARKING-MAP environment variables (see Step03), if you have NOT done it before
    2. Update password of 'sa' account (see Step08 - 8), if you have NOT done it before
    3. Package SERVER as standalone application (.jar file) by doing some steps below:
        3.1. Change package type from 'war' to 'jar' inside SERVER/pom.xml and save ! ( <packaging>jar</packaging> )
        3.2. Run TERMINAL (Command Prompt / Cmder) inside ROOT folder (folder parkingmap)
        3.3. Clean all previous built class, by tapping the command: $ mvn clean
        3.4. Compile new class and build executable .jar file, by tapping the command: $ mvn package
        3.5. Close TERMINAL, move to BUILD folder to get the executable recently packaged .jar file!

    !!!!!!!!!!!!! (Please do ALL of these steps below whenever you execute Server (server-parking-map.jar) !!!!!!!!!!!!!)

    4. Run Terminal (Command Prompt / Cmder) inside BUILD folder - folder contains all built executable file such as .jar
    5. Change code page (for using Vietnamese) with this command: (my OS is Windows !)

        $ chcp 65001

    6. Tap the following command to start server:

        $ cls && java -jar -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Xms512m -Xmx3072m -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError="shutdown -r" server-parking-map.jar

            4.0. chcp                                   : change code page
            4.1. cls                                    : clear screen
            4.2. &&                                     : concat command string
            4.3. java -jar                              : syntax for execute .jar file
            4.3. -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8                  : set encoding UTF-8
            4.4. -Xms512m                               : heap size min
            4.5. -Xmx3072m                              : heap size max
            4.6. -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m         : for faster running
            4.7. -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError="shutdown -r"   : when server is out of memory -> shutdown -> restart
            4.8. server-spring-boot.jar                 : name of executable jar file (here is Server executable jar)
